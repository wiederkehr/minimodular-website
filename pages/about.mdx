## Our Purpose

Inspired by our own adventures in the great outdoors and motivated by shortcomings of commercial products, we started to make our own gear. First to safe money by making simple commodities like roll-top bags. Then, to create alternatives to existing products with a feature set that better suits our needs like a dog harness specifically designed for sighthound body types. And finally, to invent new products that fit our personal gear setup and adventure style like a modular running vest with varying load capacities.

## Our Team

We’re a team of three: [Anna](https://www.instagram.com/wiederkehrac/), [Benjamin](https://www.instagram.com/wiederkehr/), and [Tollak](https://www.instagram.com/tollakthewhippet/). Anna and Benjamin both have a background in digital product design and are passionate distance runners and hikers. Tollak is a female whippet and undoubtedly the fastest of the pack. While Benjamin is mainly responsible for the design and development of our products, Anna and Tollak are critiquing, testing, and occasionally shredding his creations.
